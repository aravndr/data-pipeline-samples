Process a Kinesis stream of Apache access logs using EMR
=====================
This sample sets up a Data Pipeline to run an analysis on a kinesis stream every 15 minutes and store the result in S3. This requires the setup from the EMR [documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-kinesis.html).
